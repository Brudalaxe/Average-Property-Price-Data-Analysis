The dataset included in this repo contains information on the average price of properties over a 3 year period in different areas of the UK. The types of properties included in this dataset are flats, detached, semi-detached and terraced houses. We also have a second dataset telling us which one of the nine regions each area in our data belongs to. We can combine these datasets to allow us to analyse trends in the prices of properties in England.

This data is explored and analysed in the accompanying notebook, including a comparison of trends gleaned from the data, a visualisation of the change in prices over time, and a statistical analysis comprised of cross-tabulation and a Chi-square test.
